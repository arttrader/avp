# AVP
A proof of concept project I put together in 2015 for a company that eventually decided not to proceed.

In retrospect, I could have pursued development of this project further since it had a potential to become like clipchamp.

To make this fully operational you need to set up a few separate AWS instances
Some of those instances and instantiated on demand and are used purely for video processing 
Another one is used as a text-to-speech processing server
